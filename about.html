## About

Steve is a software engineer who likes digging into the code (Go code especially) and understanding how distributed systems work. In 2019, he hopes to make more contributions to Open Source projects. Professionally he is surrounded by CNCF technologies and looking to leverage / augment OSS instead of reinventing the wheel. Outside of work, you can find him Lindy Hopping in Boston or Providence, playing board games, or online playing something.
